# PCB
This is a project that I join with Academia sinica.
# Goal
Given a mother board, and the small images of possible defect, we need to find out which small images actually contain defect, and that we want to find all defect, not missing anything
# Note
Data is incomplete yet, still waiting the company to provide more data
